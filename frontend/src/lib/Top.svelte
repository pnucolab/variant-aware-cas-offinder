    Variant-aware Cas-OFFinder is a web-based tool for identifying potential CRISPR off-target sites across different genomes. It accounts for both reference genomes and individual genetic variants to improve accuracy in diverse populations. This addresses limitations caused by incomplete representation of genetic variation in reference genomes.
