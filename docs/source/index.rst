Variant-aware Cas-OFFinder
==========================

**Variant-aware Cas-OFFinder** is a variant-aware potential off-target sites identifying tool 
based on Cas-OFFinder. Using a reference genome alone to search potential off-target sites
has many drawbacks since it may not contain individual variants, making it challenging for
therapeutic applications. VarCas-OFFinder considers individual variants along with 
reference genomes to search potential off-target sites.
