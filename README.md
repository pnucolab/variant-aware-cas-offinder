# Variant-aware Cas-OFFinder

**Variant-aware Cas-OFFinder** is an advanced, high-performance tool designed to identify potential off-target sites of RNA-guided genome editors while accounting for genomic variants such as SNPs and indels. This capability is critical for increasing the precision of genome editing, especially when working with genetically diverse populations or patient-specific data.

This repository contains the full source code for:

- A web-based interactive interface
- A command-line interface (CLI)
- A Docker Compose setup for easy local deployment

---

## üåê Overview

Cas-OFFinder is widely used for identifying off-target effects in CRISPR experiments. The **variant-aware** version extends this functionality by integrating genetic variation data, allowing for more precise predictions in both research and therapeutic contexts.

Key features include:

- Support unlimited mismatches
- accounting for genetic variants (SNPs and indels)
- Scalable performance
- Easy deployment via Docker for local use

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

To run the command-line interface or deploy the web interface locally, you will need:

- An **OpenCL-compatible device** (GPU or CPU)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for web deployment)
- Python 3.10+ (for CLI and backend utilities)
- Optional: Access to variant files in VCF format for personalized analysis
